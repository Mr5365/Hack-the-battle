    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
        We are a team of passionate developers who love creating simple, classic games for everyone to enjoy. Our mission is to bring engaging and fun experiences to your browser, focusing on the core joy of gaming without any of the complications.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>
        This journey began with a single animated image and a simple idea: to build a library of games using fundamental web technologies. From there, we've brought a variety of games to life, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Arcade Classics:</b> Our collection features high-flying Flappy Bird, fast-paced Ping-Pong, and the timeless challenge of T-Rex.</li>
        <li><b>Puzzles & Strategy:</b> Test your wits with our mind-bending 15 Puzzle, the strategic Tic Tac Toe AI, and the classic block-stacking fun of Tetris.</li>
        <li><b>Card & Hand Games:</b> For a different kind of fun, weâ€™ve developed a digital version of UNO, a unique Fruit Slicer game, and a nostalgic take on Hand Cricket.</li>
        <li><b>Mini-Games:</b> Dive into our other creations, like the ever-popular Snake game and the "Clash Royale Mini" game for some fast-paced action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        We believe that great games don't need complicated setups or powerful hardware. That's why we build all our projects using the foundational trio of the web: <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>. This approach ensures our games are lightweight, accessible, and instantly playable on any device.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for playing our games. We hope you have as much fun with them as we had creating them.
    </p>
